# Password Generator Project

## About This Project
This project was created as part of the Frontend Career Path on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). The course provided the initial setup and requirements, while I implemented the functionality and styling from scratch.

## What I've Done and Learned 🎯

### JavaScript Concepts
- **Functions**: How to create and reuse functions
  - `generateRandomCharacter()`: A function that generates one random character
  - `getRandomPassword()`: A function that combines multiple characters into a password
- **Arrays**: Working with character arrays and using them as building blocks
- **Loops**: Using for-loops to repeat actions (adding 14 characters)
- **DOM Manipulation**: Modifying HTML elements from JavaScript
  - `document.getElementById()`
  - Using `.textContent` to update text

### CSS Skills
- Consistent use of margins and padding
- Working with colors and backgrounds
- Hover effects on buttons
- Structuring layout with containers

### HTML Structure
- Semantic HTML with header and main sections
- Connecting buttons to JavaScript functions
- Effective use of classes and IDs

### Debug Skills
- Using console.log to check output
- Using DevTools to test code
- Step-by-step problem solving

## Key Insights 💡
- The importance of breaking code into smaller, reusable functions
- How to use for-loops to repeat actions
- Why clear naming of variables and functions matters
- How to make JavaScript, HTML, and CSS work together

## Technical Details 🔧
- Generating random numbers with `Math.random()`
- Array indexing and element retrieval
- Event handling for buttons
- String manipulation by combining characters

## Next Steps 🚀
Possible extensions for this project:
- Make password length adjustable
- Add copy to clipboard functionality
- Add choice for different character types (letters/numbers/symbols)
- Add password strength indicator
